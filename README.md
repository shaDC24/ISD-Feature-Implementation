# ISD-Feature-Implementation


# 📚 Course Management System

A modern **Course Management Module** inspired by **Udemy**, designed as part of **CSE 326: Information System Design Sessional**. This project focuses on enabling instructors to create, manage, and deliver engaging online courses, while allowing students to track progress and interact through ratings and reviews.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design a scalable and user-friendly **Course Management System** that supports multimedia learning, progress tracking, downloadable resources, and feedback mechanisms — excluding basic authentication features such as login, registration, and user profiles.

This repository represents the **design and documentation phase** of the system and serves as the **proposal reference** for our project presentation.
